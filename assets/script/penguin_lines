Hello! Welcome to this training exercise in accessibility for development!|1
My name is _____ and I will be with you throughout this entire exercise!|1
We will start things off with a simple game of find the object.|0
I would like you to find and click on the RED car within this space! (click this speech bubble to close the dialogue)|0
Spot on! That was the RED car!|2
Not quite! Give it another go! Click on the RED car!|3
That wasn't too tough, was it?|0
That's because you are likely a trichromat. This means you have three seperate channels capable of interpreting colour information.|0
These three channels deal with red, green, and blue colour information respectively.|0
Let's have a look at this same task through someone else's eyes!|0
I've randomised the order of the cars now and displayed the cars as someone with protonopia would see them.|1
This means that only two of the three channels of information are working properly.|0
The red channel is entirely cut out, causing objects that are green and red to appear yellow.|0
The task is far tricker now, right?|4
I could ask you to find the RED car once again and you may be able to do it but you can see it'd be far harder than before.|4
The way you see this task now is the way that many colourblind people will see when using your applications.|1
This is why colour is so important within accessible design.|2
How would a colourblind user overcome this challenge though?|4
OPEN the TOOLS in the top right of this screen and I'll show you!|1
Ahhh! A SCREEN READER! This will read out exactly what is on the display to the user.|2
Switch it on and we'll find out what car is what!|2
Hmmm. The developer who made this task clearly wasn't thinking about accessibility here.|4
A visually impaired user relies on the alt text of an image to understand what's on the page!|2
Be sure to write clear and accurate alt texts for all of your images or else visually impaired users may find your site tricky to navigate!|3
Let's fix this alt text!|4
Okay! Now turn on the screen reader again!|2
That's now far clearer for you and your user to understand what they're doing on your web application!|0
Doing this one simple step will instantly make your site easier to navigate for all users.|0
In this second task, we're going to have a look at web forms.|0
We all know them. We've all used them. They are a staple of any signup page|0
And they look a little something like this!|1
It looks straight-forward, right?|1
Fill in the form and then hit submit when you're done!|0
Read the error and try again.|3
Perfect!|2
This task wasn't too tough as you had the visual clues you needed to understand the form.|0
You could see clear labels indicating what each box and button was for.|1
Let's take a look at this task through a different pair of eyes!|0
This is now how a user with cataracts would see the same form.|1
It's nearly impossible to make out what the labels say and understand what the form elements do.|4
Cataracts fog over the front of the eye and blur either part or the entirety of the person's vision.|0
Depending on the size of the cataract, this can either be a small amount, or completely distort their vision.|0
Cataracts often start as blurred vision and can lead to total blindness.|0
A user with cataracts would use this form using a screen reader.|0
Let's open up the screen reader again and make sense of this form!|2
Once again, this developer has not been thinking about accessibility when building this form.|4
As you saw, the screen reader hopped straight to the text boxes and the buttons without reading the labels.|0
This means the form controls must not be linked within the code!|4
Let's have a look at how to fix this!|2
