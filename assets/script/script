*Hello! Welcome to this training exercise in accessibility for development!|1
*My name is _____ and I will be with you throughout this entire exercise!|1
*We will start things off with a simple game of find the object.|0
*I would like you to find and click on the RED car within this space! (click this speech bubble to close the dialogue)|0
*Spot on! That was the RED car!|2
*Not quite! Give it another go! Click on the RED car!|3
*That wasn't too tough, was it?|0
*That's because you are likely a trichromat. This means you have three seperate channels capable of interpreting colour information.|0
*These three channels deal with red, green, and blue colour information respectively.|0
*Let's have a look at this same task through someone else's eyes!|0
*This is Michael!|1
^Hello!|0
*Tell them a bit about yourself Michael.|2
^I'm 47 and I have protonopia. It's a form of colour blindness meaning only two of the three channels of information to my eye function correctly.|0
^The red channel is entirely cut out, causing objects that you would see as green or red to appear yellow to me.|0
^OPEN the STORY tab to read more about my life and get to know me!|0
*I've now randomised the order of the cars and displayed them as someone like Michael, with protonopia, would see them.|1
*The task is far tricker now, right?|4
*I could ask you to find the RED car once again and you may be able to do it but you can see it'd be far harder than before.|4
*The way you see this task now is the way that many colourblind people will see when using your applications.|1
*This is why colour is so important within accessible design.|2
*So Michael, how would a colour blind user overcome this challenge?|4
^It's far easier if I were to show you how I do it.|0
^OPEN the TOOLS in the top right of this screen and I'll show you!|1
*Ahhh! A SCREEN READER! This will read out exactly what is on the display to the user.|2
^Press PLAY so we can discover which car is which!|2
*Hmmm. The developer who made this task clearly wasn't thinking about accessibility here.|4
^A visually impaired user such as myself relies on the alt text of an image to understand what's on the page!|2
*Be sure to write clear and accurate alt texts for all of your images or else visually impaired users may find your site tricky to navigate!|1
*Let's fix this alt text!|4
*Okay! Now turn on the screen reader again!|2
*That's now far clearer for you and your user to understand what they're doing on your web application!|0
*Doing this one simple step will instantly make your site easier to navigate for all users.|0
^Oh wow! That made this task a breeze for me - just as it was for you the first time! Thank you so much for fixing the alt text!|2
^With small changes like this making the page more accessible, you can ensure users such as myself keep coming back to your website!|2
*Thank you for helping out, Michael! It's been really useful to chat to you.|2
*That's the end of task one! You can move on to the second task by clicking the next task button or you can open up the STORY tab and have another read about Michael's life|1
*In this second task, we're going to have a look at web forms.|0
*We all know them. We've all used them. They are a staple of any signup page|0
*And they look a little something like this!|1
*It looks straight-forward, right?|1
*Fill in the form and then hit submit when you're done!|0
*Read the error and try again.|3
*Perfect!|2
*This task wasn't too tough as you had the visual clues you needed to understand the form.|0
*You could see clear labels indicating what each box and button was for.|1
*Let's take a look at this task through a different pair of eyes!|0
*Here's Barbara to give her view of this form!|1
^Hello there! Lovely to meet you.|0
*Tell them about yourself, Barbara!|2
^Well I'm Barbara and I've developed cataracts. This means I have a small fog over the front of my eye, causing my vision to blur.|0
^This started off relatively small with only a small amount of blurring but, through the years, my vision has become increasingly blurry.|0
^This hasn't stopped me living my life though! OPEN my STORY to get to know me better!|0
*This is now how Barbara would see the same form you just filled in.|1
*It's nearly impossible to make out what the labels say and understand what the form elements do.|4
*How would you use this form Barbara?|0
^Like all visually impaired users who still have good hearing, I would use a screen reader.|0
^Open the TOOLS once again to access the screen reader!|0
*Let's press play on the screen reader again and make sense of this form!|2
*Sorry Barbara. Once again, this developer has not been thinking about accessibility when building this form.|4
^I'm not sure what I am supposed to be doing with this form? Sounds like a few text boxes and buttons but how do I use them?|0
*As you saw, the screen reader hopped straight to the text boxes and the buttons without reading any of the labels.|0
*To someone like Barbara, this is impossible to interpret.|4
*This means the form controls must not be linked within the code!|4
*Let's have a look at how to fix this!|2
*Press the play button again and hear what has changed.|1
*As you heard, linking the form elements to the labels allows the screen reader to understand which box and button belongs to which element.|0
^Now I can easily navigate this form! Thanks for fixing it.|0
^Normally, when I come across forms that I cannot understand, I will find a different site to use offering the same service.|0
*See how a fix so simple could cost you important customers? Hopefully you'll keep Barbara in mind the next time you are designing a form.|4
*Thanks for all your help Barbara!|2
^It's been a pleasure _____. Goodbye!|0
*This ends the training exercise. Please press CLOSE to exit the application when you are ready.|0
